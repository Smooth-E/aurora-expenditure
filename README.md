# Expenditure for Sailfish OS

Expenditure is a helpful companion for tracking and splitting bills, project or
trip expenses among groups with extended support for multiple currencies. This
comes in handy e.g. on a group-trip through different countries while at the
same time keeping track of other bills at home.

**Features:**

- create multiple projects with different members
- add and edit expenses
- use multiple currencies with constant or date-specific exchange rates
- calculate total and individual spending overview
- generate settlement suggestion
- backup and restore project expenses
- share report

This app is in BETA state. Please acknowledge a VERY slow pace of development.
