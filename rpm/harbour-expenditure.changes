* Fri Aug 08 2025 Mirian Margiani <mixosaurus+ichthyo@pm.me> 2.0.0-1

- Improved handling of missing exchange rates: sums are now calculated properly using a 1:1 exchange rate and missing exchange rates are highlighted
- Added option to change the decimal precision of settlement results (results are rounded, calculations always use high precision)
